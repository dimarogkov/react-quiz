## About App

An application that will help you pass any quiz you like. You can also add a new quiz, delete or change it. There is a function to search for a quiz by name on the main page, so you can easily find the quiz you need.

When creating a quiz, it is possible to add a question that will have more than one correct answer, which gives quizzes more flexibility. You can also delete and modify the quiz itself. When changing, the logic is the same as when creating.

When you go to the selected quiz, you have the opportunity to pass it by choosing the answer options. When passing the quiz, there is a timer that will show you how much time you spent on it.

After answering all the questions, you will be taken to the results page, where you will be able to see the number of correct answers, the answers you chose and the opportunity to take the quiz again.

In the development process I used **React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS**. For the database I used **localStorage**.
